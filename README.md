Compage
=======

The OED defines compage as joining together, structure and it comes from Latin. 

Compage is a framework that supports queries being made to a data store and some 
manipulation to be done to this date, such as driling into it or finding semantic 
context or linked graphs from the data. 

The current implementation uses LinkedData but equally a SQL or similar database
should be possible. 

The database access layer just needs a template to be provided and the configuration
for the remote back end.
